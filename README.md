# PCR GUI
Visualize and control an arduino running a PCR setup



The plan:
- Arduino program for direct control
- Processing/Python GUI for on-site variable input/visualization
- Plotly for run-time visualizations
- Plotly widget + more on tuftssyntheticbiology.com

to do:
- allow touchdown anneal times
- gray out input fields after submit
- save previous run setups (with names)
- give choices of previous setups
