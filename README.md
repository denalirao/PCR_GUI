# PCR GUI
Visualize and control an arduino running a PCR setup



The plan:
- Arduino program for direct control of hardware (thermocooler, etc)
- Processing/Python GUI for on-site variable input/visualization
- Plotly for run-time (remote?) visualizations
- Plotly widget + more on tuftssyntheticbiology.com


To Do:
- allow touchdown anneal times
- gray out input fields after submit
- give choices of previous setups

Done:
- basic arduino interface - will change with hardware changes
- basic gui
- save previous run setups (with names) - 3/30/16
